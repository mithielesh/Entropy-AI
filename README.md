# Entropy AI
---

## Overview
Entropy AI is a multi-agent intelligence platform designed to simulate, observe, and reason about complex system behavior under stress. Rather than relying on a single monolithic AI model, the system distributes intelligence across multiple autonomous agents that interact and adapt during runtime. This enables realistic modeling of adversarial scenarios, cascading failures, and recovery strategies.

---

## Core Concept: Multi-Agent Intelligence
Entropy AI is built around a coordinated set of agents, each responsible for a specific role such as attack simulation, system monitoring, or recovery orchestration. Agents operate independently while sharing contextual state, allowing the system to evolve dynamically instead of following static workflows.

This architecture mirrors real-world environments where multiple actors influence system behavior simultaneously.

---

## Entropy-Based Analysis
Entropy is used as a conceptual measure of system instability and uncertainty. As agents introduce stress or mitigation actions, changes in system behavior are continuously observed to understand how instability propagates and how resilience is restored.

The focus is on behavioral analysis over time rather than binary success or failure.

## Running the Project

The platform supports both local and containerized execution.

- Start backend services using **FastAPI with Uvicorn**
- Run containerized components using **Docker**
- Build frontend assets using **npm run build**

---

## Why Entropy AI
Entropy AI demonstrates how agent-based systems can be applied to cybersecurity testing, system resilience analysis, and distributed decision intelligence. By emphasizing interaction, adaptation, and uncertainty, the platform provides insights that are difficult to obtain with single-model AI approaches.
